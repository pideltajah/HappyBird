A Flappy Bird inspired game

This game is written in C++ using Microsoft Visual Studio IDE and utilizes SFML API found at sfml-dev.org.
The game starts immediately upon execution. The user left-clicks to "flap" and elevate the bird and right-clicks
to dive which accelerates the rate at which the bird falls. Obstacles must be navigated to gain points and if hit,
the bird dies and falls to the ground. The player gets three lives before it is game over.
